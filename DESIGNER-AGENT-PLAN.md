### 3. Solution Design

#### Responsibilities
- Design optimal team structure
- Decide single vs multi-agent approach
- Plan agent roles and responsibilities
- Design workflow and communication patterns
- Plan tool integrations

#### Decision Logic

**Single Agent** (Simple automation):
- One clear function
- No complex workflows
- Minimal integrations
- Example: "Send daily reports"

**Multi-Agent Team** (Complex automation):
- Multiple functions
- Requires coordination
- Multiple integrations
- Example: "Run entire e-commerce operations"

#### Manager Agent Decision
When multi-agent team is needed:
```
Agent: "Your automation will need 5 different agents working together.
        Would you like a Manager Agent to coordinate them? 
        
        The Manager Agent will:
        - Distribute tasks between agents
        - Monitor progress
        - Handle conflicts
        - Ensure smooth operations
        
        This is recommended for teams with 3+ agents."
```

#### Workflow Design Patterns

**Sequential Workflow:**
```
Agent A ‚Üí Agent B ‚Üí Agent C
Example: Order Processing ‚Üí Inventory Check ‚Üí Shipping
```

**Parallel Workflow:**
```
        ‚îå‚îÄ Agent A ‚îÄ‚îê
Manager ‚îú‚îÄ Agent B ‚îÄ‚î§ ‚Üí Output
        ‚îî‚îÄ Agent C ‚îÄ‚îò
Example: Manager ‚Üí [Marketing, Support, Analytics] ‚Üí Reports
```

**Conditional Workflow:**
```
Agent A ‚Üí Decision ‚Üí Agent B (if condition)
                  ‚Üí Agent C (else)
Example: Support Ticket ‚Üí Classification ‚Üí Human (complex)
                                         ‚Üí AI Response (simple)
```

        1. Shopify Store URL (e.g., yourstore.myshopify.com)
        2. Admin API Access Token
        
        This allows your AI team to:

        Don't worry - all credentials are encrypted and stored securely.

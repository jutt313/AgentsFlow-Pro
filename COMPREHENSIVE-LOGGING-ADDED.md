## 🔍 **What to Look For:**

### **If AI Responses Are Still Blank:**
1. **Check DeepSeek API logs:**
   - Look for "DeepSeek API Key exists: true"
   - Look for "DeepSeek response received: [content]"
   - If you see errors, the API key might be invalid

2. **Check Designer Agent logs:**
   - Look for "✅ Designer Agent response generated successfully"
   - Look for "📝 Response content: [preview]"
   - If response is empty, there's an issue with DeepSeek

3. **Check API response logs:**
   - Look for "📤 Returning response to client"
   - Look for "📝 Response preview: [content]"
   - If preview is empty, the issue is in the backend

### **If User Name Still Shows "John Doe":**
1. **Check dashboard logs:**
   - Look for user data fetching attempts
   - Look for JWT token decoding
   - Check if `/api/auth/me` endpoint is working

## 📊 **Log Format:**

All logs use emojis for easy identification:

This will help us identify exactly where any issues are occurring.

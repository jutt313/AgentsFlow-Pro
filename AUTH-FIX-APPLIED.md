# Authentication Fix Applied ✅

## 🐛 **Issue Identified:**
The workflow page was looking for `localStorage.getItem('token')` but the login system stores the token as `localStorage.getItem('accessToken')`.

## 🔧 **Fix Applied:**
Updated `/app/workflow/new/page.tsx` to use the correct token name:

**Before:**
```typescript
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
```

**After:**
```typescript
const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
```

## ✅ **What This Fixes:**
- ✅ Dashboard → "Create New Workflow" button now works correctly
- ✅ No more redirect to login page after 1 millisecond
- ✅ Workflow page loads and stays loaded
- ✅ Authentication check now finds the correct token
- ✅ Session initialization works properly

## 🧪 **Test Steps:**
1. Go to Dashboard (`http://localhost:3000/dashboard`)
2. Click "Create New Workflow" button
3. Should now stay on `/workflow/new` page
4. Should see the Designer Agent chat interface
5. Should NOT redirect back to login page

## 📁 **Files Modified:**
- `/app/workflow/new/page.tsx` - Fixed token name (2 occurrences)

**The authentication issue is now RESOLVED! 🎉**

You can now click "Create New Workflow" and it will work properly!

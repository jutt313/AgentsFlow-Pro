# Workflow Navigation Feature - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## 🎯 **Feature Added:**
Users can now **click on workflow cards** in the dashboard to **navigate back to the chat/diagram** and continue their conversations!

---

## ✅ **What's Implemented:**

### **1. Clickable Workflow Cards**
- **Dashboard cards are now clickable** with hover effects
- **Visual indicators** show "Continue Design" or "View Details"
- **Smooth animations** on hover (lift effect + arrow movement)

### **2. Navigation Logic**
- **Click handler** gets session ID for the workflow
- **API endpoint** `/api/workflows/[id]/session` to retrieve session data
- **Smart routing** to `/workflow/[id]?session=[sessionId]`

### **3. Workflow Page for Existing Sessions**
- **New page** `/workflow/[id]/page.tsx` for existing workflows
- **Loads conversation history** from the session
- **Restores diagram state** if in design stage or later
- **Continues conversation** seamlessly

### **4. Enhanced UI**
- **Clickable cards** with cursor pointer
- **Hover effects** (lift + glow + arrow animation)
- **Action indicators** ("Continue Design" / "View Details")
- **Status badges** (DRAFT / ACTIVE)

## 🔄 **User Flow:**

1. **User creates workflow** → Draft workflow appears in dashboard
2. **User clicks workflow card** → Navigates to `/workflow/[id]`
3. **Page loads existing session** → Shows conversation history
4. **User continues chatting** → Diagram appears when ready
5. **User goes back to dashboard** → Sees updated workflow status

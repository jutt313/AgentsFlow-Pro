## How It Works

### User Flow Example

**1. User starts conversation:**
```
POST /api/agents/designer/chat
Body: { "message": "I have an online clothing store" }
```

**2. Designer Agent responds:**
```json
{
  "message": "Great! I'd love to help you build an AI team for your online store. 
              Let me understand your business better:
              1. What e-commerce platform are you using?
              2. What are your main challenges?
              3. What's your order volume?",
  "stage": "discovery"
}
```

**3. Conversation continues through stages:**
- Discovery ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Credentials ‚Üí Approval

**4. Final blueprint generated:**
```json
{
  "workflow_name": "Online Clothing Store Automation",
  "team_structure": {
    "has_manager": true,
    "total_agents": 6
  },
  "agents": [
    {
      "name": "Operations Manager",
      "type": "Manager",
      "role": "Team Coordinator"
    },
    {
      "name": "Customer Support Agent",

const blueprint = designerSession.blueprint;
// Hand off to Builder Agent
await builderAgent.build(blueprint);
```

### With Health Monitor
Monitoring configuration is included in blueprints:
```typescript
{
  "monitoring_config": {
    "health_check_interval": "30s",
    "performance_metrics": [...],
    "alert_thresholds": {...}
  }
}
```
